title: About
---

My name is Norman Liu, and I'm a dev from Vancouver. I graduated with a B.Sc.in Biology, but realized way too late that my real passion was code. In my spare time, I'm usually exploring open-source projects, playing music, or grinding through LeetCode questions (currently at 600-something).

I love reading into the history and complexities of computation, algorithms, and puzzles. It's immensely more satisfying than rote memorization of biological pathways.

I also have an affinity for turbocharged, AWD, manual station wagons. Please feel free to send me pictures of these.
